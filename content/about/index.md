I'm an Applied Mathematics and Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Besides diving deep into algorithms and mathematical theories, I'm a big coffee enthusiast. So, if you ever wish to discuss tech, math, or simply enjoy a cup of coffee, I'm all ears!

## Who am I

At the heart of it, I'm a curious learner, always exploring the convergence of math and technology. My journey at UW-Madison has equipped me with a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical experiences, making me a holistic student of both subjects.

## Skills
My skillset spans multiple domains, mostly cultivated through academics, but also some hands-on learning. I have a wide experience with many different languages, platforms and frameworks, but if I put it on this list then I am fairly comfortable with it.

**Programming**
- Java
- Python
- Git

**Mathematics**
- Probability Theory
- Game Theory
- Partial Differential Equations

**Platforms**
- Google Cloud
- Docker

**Applications**
- Excel

## My Experience

**Note:** My resume can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1dRA4Pp-J19tKqmcToK0qqC9SvJqn9kHx).

During my tenure as an Assistant Technician at Mobile One Wireless, I delved into a wide spectrum of tasks â€” mostly mobile and PC repairs, but it was also my first introduction to Excel. Additionally, my role as a Coding Tutor at Code Wiz saw me guiding students through the nuances of Java, Lua, and Python, while innovatively adapting to the challenges posed by remote learning.
